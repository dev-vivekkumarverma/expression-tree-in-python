# Expression Tree

Welcome to the Expression Tree project repository! This project is aimed at implementing and demonstrating the functionality of an Expression Tree using Python 3.11. 

## Introduction

An **Expression Tree** is a binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. In an expression tree, the leaves are operands (e.g., constants or variables), and the other nodes are operators. This data structure is particularly useful for evaluating expressions and performing symbolic computations.

## Use of Expression Tree

The main uses of an Expression Tree include:

- **Evaluation of Expressions**: Compute the result of the expression represented by the tree.
- **Expression Manipulation**: Simplify, differentiate, or integrate expressions symbolically.
- **Conversion**: Convert between infix, prefix, and postfix notations.

## Scope of the Project

This project covers the following functionalities:

1. **Construction**: Building an expression tree from infix, prefix, or postfix expressions.
2. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the expression represented by the tree.
3. **Traversal**: Traversing the tree in different orders (infix, prefix, postfix).
4. **Conversion**: Converting expressions between different notations.

## Code Snippets and Examples

### Building an Expression Tree

Here's an example of building an expression tree from a postfix expression:

```python
# Example usage
postfix = "53+82-*"
root = construct_tree(postfix)
```

### Evaluating an Expression Tree

```python
# Example usage
result = evaluate(root)
print(f"The result of the expression is: {result}")
```

### Traversing an Expression Tree

#### Infix Traversal

```python
# Example usage
inorder(root)
```

#### Prefix Traversal

```python
# Example usage
preorder(root)
```

#### Postfix Traversal

```python
# Example usage
postorder(root)
```

### Converting Between Notations

#### Infix to Postfix Conversion

```python
# Example usage
infix = "3+(5*2)-8"
postfix = infix_to_postfix(infix)
print(f"Postfix expression: {postfix}")
```
